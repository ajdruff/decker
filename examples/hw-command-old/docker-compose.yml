############variable substitution########
#To set the variables within this file, edit .env or set using a shell script before running docker-compose.yml
############container environmental variables########
#(equivilent to docker run -e VARIABLE=VALUE)
#To set environmental variables in a service container,
#create a file service_name.env and place in the docker directory
#add an env_file definition under the service:
     #env_file:
     #    - docker/service-name.env
#alternately, you can simply use the 'environment' tag and assign values that are set in the .env file

#The  variable values that you see in this file  ,e.g: ${VAR_NAME} , are set in the local .env file
#variables (as opposed to variable values) that are set in this file are valid only within the container they associated with
#BUILD_VAR1 is only seen by the build script and not the containier
#MYSERVICE_ENV1 is only seen by the container 'myservice'
